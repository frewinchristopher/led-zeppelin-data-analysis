Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been

To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Whoa-oh-hoh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Ooh, oh, baby, I've been flying, no, yeah
Mama cares, ain't no denying
Oh, ooh yes, I've been flying
My mama, ain't no denying, no denying, no

Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find
Where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that led me to that place
With yellow desert screen

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that blows high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-hoh, oh, oh

Whoa, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way you stay, yeah-eah

Ooh, yeah-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah
When I'm down, oh
Ooh, yeah-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah
When I'm down, so down

Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby
Let me take you there

Oh, oh, come on, come on, oh
Let me take you there
Let me take you there

Woo, yeah-yeah
Woo, yeah-yeah
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
