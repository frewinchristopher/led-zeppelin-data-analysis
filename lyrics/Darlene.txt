Ooh c'mon baby, give me, me some

When I see you at that dance
With your tight dress on
What you got, it sure is fine

Ooh baby baby, Darlene
Ah, be my baby, Darlene
Oh, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, my babe

Darlene
Ooh, Darlene
Hey hey, Darlene
Oh oh, come back and be my, mmm, sweet little girl

When I see you on the street
It makes my heart go flitter
I see you walkin' with all those guys
It make me feel so sick

Now I don't care what people say
And I don't care what they do
Sweet child, I gotta make you mine
You're the only thing that I want: you, yeah

And baby baby, when you walk down the block
See the people fight
Whoo child, y'know ya drive me wild
I gotta do it with you, come on try

Ooh, baby, I got my car
I'll take you where it's fine
I'm gonna take you every place
Do ya wanna boogie-woogie-woogie-woogie-woogie that's fine?

I'm gonna boogie, Darlene
I'm gonna make ya my girl
I'm gonna boogie, a-Darlene
I'm gonna send you in another world

'Cause I love, a-Darlene
And I love you, yes I do
I've been savin' all my money
I've been workin' all day long
I gotta give it all back to you

Oh, but I love you, Darlene
Yes, I love you, yes I do
I've been workin', it's true
I've been workin' every day
I've been tryin' a-get it home to you

And I love you, Darlene
Yes, I love you, I do
I got a pink carnation and a pickup truck
A-savin' it all for you

Oh, I love you

Go

Go, go, go, go, go

Oh
