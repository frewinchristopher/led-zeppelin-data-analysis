I've got a baby y'know
Treats me fine
I got a little woman wanna give it but, uh
I get it all the time
Well she's my
Sunshine baby
She's nice and kind to me
Well she give me breakfast in the mornin'
You know she
Also makes my tea

She got no diamond, you know
Shine like gold
Got a mortgage on my body
Got a lien on my soul

When my baby walks ya know
Her front teeth they shine like gold, yes they do
Well-a ya know she shine like diamond
But she got a mortgage on my soul, hah

Get up, get up, now

My baby when she walks, you know
Shakes just like a willow tree
Yeah my baby when she walks, you know
Shakes just like a willow tree
But she's so mean and evil
She makes a monkey outta me

Oh yeah, my my my
